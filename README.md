# RoboCar
My Project to create a robot car with a camera.

<b> This is work in progress. </b>(

# Basic setup: Raspberry Pi powered Robot Car
##Hardware:
* Joy-IT chassis, wheels and electrical motors. You can find an example [https://www.conrad.nl/p/joy-it-arduino-robot-car-kit-01-robot03-robot-chassis-1573542] (Dutch website)
* Raspberry Pi and L298N motor bridge.
* a PiCamera with ribbon. Preferably a PiCamera holder.
* Batteries for motors and batteries for RPi + wires/plugs to connect the batteries
* Jumper wires

* a laptop or tablet with VNC installed to control the car (see below for VNC)

## Software
We use python
* use gpiozero library to control the engines
* use PiCamera
* See code for scripts

### VNC
Use this [https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/] tutorial to install VNC on both your device and the Pi. Make sure you have an account and are logged in on both devices.
