# RoboCar
My Project to create a mini car and using AI to control it.

<b> This is an ongoing project! </b>

# Basic setup: Arduino powered Robot Car
##Hardware:
* Joy-mii chassis, wheels and electrical motors.
* Arduino Uno 
* Motor shield for Arduino
* Bluetooth receiver HC-05
* Batteries for motors and batteries for Arduino + wires to connect them
* Jumper wires

* an Android device (tablet/phone) for controlling the car using bluetooth

##Software
* use the .ino file for controlling the Arduino
* Android app can be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/bluetoothrccar/home/3BluetoothModulesAndArduinoCode 
* Or create your own app with MIT AppInventor

## Wiring / set up:
